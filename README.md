## My JS13K Entry, 2017

I submitted this night/weekend project to JS13K Games for 2017. JS13K a friendly competition where you try to build a game using HTML/CSS/JS only and have to keep your deliverables under 13k, compressed. You have a month to complete it.

Here's [more info](http://js13kgames.com/) on the competition.

## The Lost Theme

The theme of this year's contest is "Lost." Instead of doing just another maze'ish thing I applied the theme towards game mechanics. Check Yourself is about lost perspective, lost control, and lost strategy.

Checkers is an immensely popular game that damned near everyone knows how to play. I thought, "How can I mix it up to incorporate the 'lost' theme?"

### Lost Perspective

You play as one checker. You can see the normal 8x8 game board only from the perspective of your one checker, right in the thick of things without the luxury of a constant "God view."

### Lost Control

In a normal game of checkers you control an entire team. In Check Yourself, you control your one checker. You play as you, and you alone.

### Lost Strategy

Since you can't control your team and have limited perspective, your ability to strategize is hampered. In early demo builds I found this altered the way I played significantly. I was much more cavalier. I didn't care nearly as much about moving my back row or getting "killed."

## Feedback and Bugs

If you have anything to share or find something grossly wrong, hit me up. The contest closed September 13, 2017 ... but I'm thinking I'll cut a branch and continue to work on this.

This was my first time doing anything like this and I'm pretty tickled with how the game turned out. Still, I left a few things on the table, namely:

## Dropped Ops

### Sound!

I had room to add sound and there are some great JS sound engines out there I could have utilized. That hourglass, though ...

### AI

The enemies and your squad is totally random. I had hooks and to-dos to make the AI better and ran out of minutes.

### More Cool Effects

I'm pretty proud of the goofy little crown I made with CSS when a checker gets kinged. In future builds I'll include more bells/whistles for in-game events.

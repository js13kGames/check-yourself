## My JS13K Entry, 2017

This is a hobby project I'm entering into JS13K Games for 2017. It's a friendly competition where you try to build a game using HTML/CSS/JS only and have to keep your deliverables under 13k, compressed. You have a month to complete it.

Here's [more info](http://js13kgames.com/) on the competition.

## Lost

The theme of this year's contest is "Lost." Instead of doing just another maze'ish thing I applied the theme towards game mechanics. Check Yourself is about lost perspective, lost control, and lost strategy.

Checkers is an immensely popular game that damned near everyone knows how to play. I thought, "How can I mix it up to incorporate the 'lost' theme?"

### Lost Perspective

You play as one checker. You can see the normal 8x8 game board only from the perspective of your one checker, right in the thick of things. Playing a simple game of checkers outside of "God view" puts a new twist on it.

### Lost Control

In a normal game of checkers you control an entire team. In Check Yourself, you control a single checker. You're able to issue general strategies for your squad, and they'll try to honor your wishes ... but sometimes can't. You play as you, and you alone.

### Lost Strategy

Since you can't control your team and you have limited perspective, your ability to strategize is hampered. In early demo builds I found this altered the way I played significantly. I was much more cavalier. I didn't care nearly as much about moving my back row or getting "killed."

## Feedback and Bugs

If you have anything to share or find something grossly wrong, hit me up. The contest ends September 13, 2017 ... if you're seeing this prior to then, there's still time to fix stuff!

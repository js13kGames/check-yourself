/**
 * Base Settings Defining the Viewport
 *
 * As with all model components, it's a simple object whose attributes can be
 * explicitly set or calculated on-the-fly. When this is imported into our
 * global model construct, 'this' context is automatically provided.
 *
 * Note that derived (function) properties can not be set or watched.
